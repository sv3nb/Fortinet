# Fortinet
Netsec automation for Fortinet

Main folder contains python scripts and jinja templates to automate the creation of firewall (address) objects.
I used a similar script for a customer' firewall migration to generate about 440 lines of cli code in 2 seconds.
Combine this for example with the HTTP requests library in python to make API calls to the fortigate using JSON/RPC.

More scripts will be added in the future.
